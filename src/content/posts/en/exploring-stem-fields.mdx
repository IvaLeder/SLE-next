Before we start exploring STEM fields, we strongly recommend that you read [What is STEM and why is it important](http://www.stemlittleexplorers.com/en/what-is-stem-and-why-is-it-important/) where we introduce you to the STEM acronym.

### **Science**

Science is a vast field and includes gaining knowledge from many distinct disciplines, like chemistry, biology and physics, but more importantly, learning science is all about learning scientific method, conducting experiments and drawing conclusions based on evidence. All you need is curious mind and ingredients you can probably find in your kitchen cabinet. Or just stroll through the park and be amazed with scientific discoveries you can make now when you know where to look!

### **Technology**

Today, technology is so big part of our lives that we can feel that children are even spending too much time on it, and that we shouldn't encourage it. Quite the contrary! There is big difference between being just a passive consumers of technology and being active creators. Latter is not only fun but improves our problem solving capabilities, our creativity, orientation to detail and dealing with frustration (there will be frustration!).

### **Engineering**

Engineering is in a way application of science and technology, mostly relying on laws of physics to build interesting and useful contraptions. Fields like robotics, require programming skills to give our machines capability to do our bidding. And how fun is that?! Engineering requires to make our hands dirty with building, disassembling, using tools, so not only is it good for your child's cognitive development, it helps with motor development too! Just don't be too mad when you find new laptop disassembled in pieces.

### **Math**

Oh, math! Many people love to hate it, but it can be fun and engaging field if approached in a right way. Math is sort of a base for all other fields we talked about, so it's important to include some fun math based activities right from the start. Those are not just numbers and equations! There are actually many math activities which kids love to do such as origami and drawing fractals and who knows, maybe in doing them, you yourself find that math is not so bad!
