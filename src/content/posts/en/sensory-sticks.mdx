## Sensorimotor Development and why is it important:

We talked a lot about sensorimotor development and its importance in [Sensorimotor development and activities for Children](https://www.stemlittleexplorers.com/en/sensorimotor-activities-children/). If you are interested in a more theoretical overview, we recommend reading it.

Let’s just briefly go over the most important concepts.

Children explore the world through their senses. Everything is new and exciting to them - they must **touch**, **lick** and **chew** to understand and construct their environment. Freedom to explore nurtures their curiosity and allows them to **improve their cognitive and motor skills**.

That’s one of the basic needs of a small child and we as parents must support it. The key is to construct an environment that is interesting and stimulating but also safe. There should be many different stimuli - **textures**, **sounds**, **contrasts** and child should engage with them actively - as it interests him/her, not in some way prescribed by us.

This early sensory exploration is the basis for all other learning. If a child is curious and engaged, it will try to move towards the object of interest, grasp it, throw it. So **motoric development is closely intertwined with this sensory exploration**.

## Tips on making and using Sensory Sticks:

What I love about the sensory sticks is that there is no “right” way to make them. You can really get creative with the materials - **old socks**, **carpets**, **sponges**, **buttons** - **possibilities are endless**. Use many different textures - **fluffy**, **hard**, **soft**, **coarse** - the more the merrier.

Different materials promote curiosity and allow the child to experience a full range of stimuli. Watch out with the materials. Baby will probably want to explore sticks with her mouth first (doh!), so be sure it’s safe. As with the most toys, don’t leave your child under 3 years to play without supervision.

This is a great toy to have on the go - small, won’t take much space but can provide tons of entertainment. Best thing is, they are so easy to make, you can make the new ones every few days to keep them fresh!

## Materials needed for Sensory Sticks:
