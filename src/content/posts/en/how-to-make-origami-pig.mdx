## The symbolism of Pig

In most cultures today, the pig is associated with negative meaning and symbolism - ignorance, greed, laziness and unclean.

But in the ancient world, the pig was most often seen as a symbol of **fertility** and **abundance**. It was also seen as a sacred animal to many gods, like Isis in Egypt, Ceres in Rome and Demeter in Greece.

The native Americans perceived the pig as a **bringer of rain** which is important for fertilizing the earth. For Celts, the pig is a symbol of **strength**, **love**, **fertility**, **good luck** and **prosperity**. For Hindus, the pig is an **aspect of goddess** Vishnu that she uses to save the goddess of the earth. In Egypt, the pig is **sacred to god** Seth, the god of desert, storms, and foreigners. The pig represents the twelfth sign of Chinese zodiac. It also represents the **abundance**, **wealth** and **friendliness**.

As already mentioned, in some cultures and religions today, the pig has a more negative association. In Buddhism, the pig represents one of The three poisons - **delusion**, **greed,** and **hatred**. The Tree poisons are considered to be three afflictions or character flaws that every person carries inside. In Judaism and Islam, the pig is seen as **unclean**. Christians see it as **vile** and **rude** creature and an expression of **greed**. Also, it is often **associated with Satan** because of the footprints she leaves.
