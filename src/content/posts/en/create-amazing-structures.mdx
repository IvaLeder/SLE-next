## Importance of building at early age

> Building toys are the building blocks of the future success!

Children are natural builders. Playing with cubes, building materials or just assembling something, they can express their creativity and develop it further. **Constructing** (and **deconstructing**) are primary ways for children to find out how things work.

Many people think that playing with building materials is mainly boy activity, but that is only because we raise them that way. Encourage your daughters in building activities because they have many cognitive and motor skills benefits.

## Ideas for construction games:

When we talk about the construction games, first and often the last thing we think about is playing with building blocks. But actually, there are many other ways you can engage in building activities with the usual stuff that lie around the house.

- You can go and try to **build a blanket fort** with your child and see how big can it be without losing its stability.
- You can use **recycled materials** like cardboard and old boxes to build all sort of things. See how you can [use a plain shoe box to build a functional projector](https://www.stemlittleexplorers.com/en/how-to-make-projector-using-smartphone/).
- You can go to your local sandbox and build amazing **structures from sand**, or **use mud** to create impressive creations. Just be sure to keep washing machine on standby.
- **Sewing** and **knitting** are excellent construction activities that will greatly improve fine motor skills. Not only that, they are an excellent way to develop patience and concentration. And there is a huge feeling of success in making something by yourself.

Those are just some of the many ideas that exist for construction games. Now we are gonna show you one idea - how you can use ordinary toothpicks and playdough for an amazing building project.

## Materials needed for building with toothpicks:

![STEM Activity for Kids - How to create amazing structures - Materials Needed](/images/posts/STEM-Activity-for-Kids-How-to-create-amazing-structures-Materials-Needed.jpg)
For this simple building activity, we just need some toothpicks and playdough.

- Toothpicks or Straws
- Playdough or marshmallows or cherries

## Instructions for building:

You can check the video on the beginning of the article for some ideas on how to build structures with toothpicks and playdough or see the instructions below.

1. If you’re building with playdough and you have a lot of it, you can use some to make a foundation. It will be easier to transport your creation later. If you’re interested in how to make your own playdough, check out [how to make homemade playdough](https://www.stemlittleexplorers.com/en/make-homemade-playdough-learn-science/) article.
2. Take marshmallows and start poking toothpicks in them. If you’re using playdough, make little balls (great for fine motor skills) first and poke them. Remember not to make too big balls or they will be too heavy if you're building upwards.
3. Just use your imagination! There is no right or wrong way to build - it is important to build!

## Bonus ideas for building:

You can also use cubes, but we recommend some material that is less stable because with it you can also have a good lecture in the laws of physics. Try with the tower of cards and see how that goes.

Building Card tower is a great activity to learn laws of physics.

## What will you develop and learn by building structures?

- Logical thinking skills
- Hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills
- Math skills and problem-solving skills
- Creativity and imagination
- Patience and awareness
- Soft skills like communication and cooperation if you’re building together

We hope you will enjoy building the structures and find some creative ways to express “little architect” that sits in all of us.
