Earth, fire, air, and water have long been considered **prime elements** and essence of all life. Now we know those “natural forces” are not really elements, but something else entirely. **Fire**, for example, is a chemical reaction between oxygen in the air and fuel such as wood or coal. **Earth** and **air** are actually combinations of many different elements.

**Water** is a molecule, composed of 2 hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. But, ancient philosophers got one thing right - **water is essential for life**. There is a reason why all ancient civilizations were founded next to the rivers. Life, as we know it, depends on water.

## Water in the human body

Our body consists of **65% of water**. That’s amazing! But what’s more interesting is that certain organs like the brain and the hearth  (73%), as well as lungs (83%), depend on water consumption even more.

![Water in the body](/images/posts/The-amazing-properties-of-water-and-how-to-test-them-Water-in-the-body.jpg)
All humans and living beings are made from a lot of water

Water is our essential need, we need to **drink on average 2L per day** just to survive. And in the case of **dehydration**, our brain shifts to water saving mode. As a consequence, cognitive functions quickly decline to prevent unnecessary “wasting”.  In our body, water has **multiple roles**. Maybe the most obvious is that it **regulates our temperature** by sweating. But even more importantly, it provides **fuel for every cell** in our body. It’s also used to **metabolize and transport food** as well as to **flush waste**. It forms saliva needed for digestion and lubricates joints. Water is really essential for our everyday functioning.

## Chemical structure of water

Structurally, the molecule of water looks like a letter V. The formula for the water (H2O) is probably well known to everyone. **Two hydrogen atoms** bond with **one oxygen atom** by what is called a **covalent bond**. That means that electrons are shared between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms, not transferred.

Water is made from one Oxygen and 2 Hydrogen atoms

Oxygen is a more electronegative of two, more “greedy” for electrons, so that part of the molecule has a slightly negative charge. Another part (hydrogen part) has a slightly positive charge. This type of the molecule, with differently charged ends, is called a **polar molecule**. That polarity makes water molecules highly attracted to each other. Positively charged end of one molecule is attracted to negatively charged end of another water molecule. We say that multiple water molecules are **connected by hydrogen bonds**. That allows for some interesting properties we will discuss next.

## Adhesion and cohesion

Cohesion and adhesion define **“stickiness” of a substance**. **Cohesion** is an attraction between similar things, while **adhesion** is an attraction between different things. Water has high cohesion, it is actually highest of all nonmetallic liquids. That means that molecules of water like to stay close together (remember hydrogen bonds?).  You can see this property in action if you observe a drop of water on the wax paper. A drop of water consists of many water molecules bonded by a hydrogen bond and it retains its shape.

Adhesion and cohesion at work. See how water behaves differently

But there are cases when the attraction to other types of molecules overpowers cohesion.

Did you ever observe water on the glass? It becomes a wet mess, unlike elegant drops we saw before. Why? Well, glass molecules are even more polar than the water, so they become more attractive. This is adhesion. Adhesion and cohesion work together to achieve some really amazing things. One of them is capillary action, movement of water upwards, against the gravity. This is the principle on which the **plants transport water** around and it also helps with **blood circulation** in our body.

## The universal solvent

**A solvent** is a thing which can dissolve other things. And water can dissolve more things than any other liquid. That’s why it’s often **called the "universal solvent"**. Those things which we put in liquids are called **solutes**.

Since water is polar, it can dissolve other polar molecules and ionic compounds. Examples include table salt, food colors, and sugar. Since they dissolve in the water we call them **hydrophilic molecules**. Those that do not mix with water, such as oils, we call **hydrophobic**, water-fearing molecules. They do not dissolve in water since they are nonpolar. Nonpolar molecules interfere with the hydrogen bonding of water molecules. We explored more this topic in our [Lava lamp experiment](https://www.stemlittleexplorers.com/en/make-lava-lamp/) so try it out if you’re interested.

## Density and heat capacity

Did you know that water is **only substance** on the Earth **occurring in all 3 forms**: solid, liquid and gas? And another peculiarity: The density of the water is higher in a liquid form than in solid (ice). That’s another property unique to the water. But how is that happening? Around 0 degrees Celsius, hydrogen bonds start forming **crystalline structures**. In crystalline structures, **atoms are more spread apart** so the density is lower. That’s why the ice floats on the water!

The density of the water is higher in a liquid form than in solid

Water has a very **high heat capacity**. Actually, it has the highest heat capacity of all liquids!  That means it can absorb a lot of heat before its temperature rises. The opposite is also true: **water cools down slowly**. If you’ve ever been around the sea, you know the climate is much more pleasant. Water serves as a buffer that prevents huge differences in temperature.

Since the human body consists of much water, this property also helps us in **regulating body temperature**. Think of the various temperature conditions we find ourselves in, from freezing winters to scorching summers. We can manage it without many issues because our body uses water as a temperature buffer.
