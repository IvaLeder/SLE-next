After [Origami fortune-teller](https://www.stemlittleexplorers.com/en/develop-math-reasoning-skills-origami/) and [Origami pig](https://www.stemlittleexplorers.com/en/how-to-make-origami-pig/), today, in the spirit of summer, we will be learning how to make an Origami boat. Actually, we will show you how to make two types of boats:

- **Sailboat**, which looks awesome, but is not very stable (quick to turn over and sink)
- The **modern boa**t which is stable enough to go on long voyages

But first…

## The symbolism of the boat

The boat, as an object of **discovery** and **travel**, really has deep roots in the symbolism of all cultures. It is mentioned throughout the many famous myths and even played a lead role in some of them (Noah’s Arc, The Odyssey, etc.). It’s mentioned in many contexts, from more obvious like **traversing restless seas** (life) to less known **journeys to the afterlife**.

In **ancient Egypt**, the boat symbolized the transportation vessel for the Sun, so it can journey across the sky. It also helps the souls of the recently passed to journey to the afterlife. Just like in Egypt, in **ancient Greece**, the ferry (a type of a boat) was used to cross a river of Styx, the biggest river of the Underworld. That’s why Greeks left 2 coins on the dead, so they can pay the ferryman Charon to take them across the river of Styx.

In **Christianity**, we know the story of Noah’s Ark where Noah built a large ark (boat), gathered all types of animals, one male, and one female to save them from the great flood. The God engulfed all world in the flood to wash all sins and only Noah, his family and animals he collected survived. In **Islam**, there is a similar story “_Safina Nūḥ_” (Noah’s Boat) and also contains a great flood.

Paper Boats most often **symbolize life**. Like life, the paper boat won't float forever and eventually, it will sink because everything has an end. And like life, the paper boat is **fragile** and can be **easily destroyed**. But it also symbolizes **hope** and **innocence** because the paper boat is going against the odds and can hold against flickering water to reach its destination.

Now that we went through the symbolism, let’s start with making our own origami paper boat.
