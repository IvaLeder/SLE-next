### WHAT IS POLARITY?

**Polarity** is a chemical property of a molecule that describes a distribution of the electrical charge inside of it.

A molecule is **polar** when there is a difference between **electronegativity** of its atoms and **nonpolar** otherwise. Electronegativity describes how easy is for an atom to receive electrons.

You probably noticed that some liquids mix together well and some don’t. For example, water and sugar mix while water and oil keep separated. Why is that?

Molecules of the different polarity don’t mix together, in this case, both sugar and water are polar molecules and the oil is nonpolar.

If you want to know more details about polarity, please read our [Lava lamp experiment](http://www.stemlittleexplorers.com/en/make-lava-lamp/) article, where we discuss this topic in more detail.

### SCIENCE BEHIND THE COLORFUL MILK POLARITY EXPERIMENT

Milk contains few different ingredients, mostly **water**, but also some **mineral, proteins and fat**. And we already learned water is polar molecule while all fats are nonpolar.

But what about the **dish soap**? Soap is used primarily for washing different types of **grease** and dirt, stuff that water can’t dissolve by itself. And to be able to do that effectively it must be able to mix with nonpolar molecules. On the other hand, we know that we can mix soap with water and get a bubbly solution. How is that?

Well, soap molecule is made out of the l**ong nonpolar tail and short polar head**, so it can mix with both types of molecules!

When we put it into the milk, the nonpolar tail will collect fat molecules, while the head will mingle with the water molecules.

In all that movement, the food colors are pushed around and we can observe a real visual spectacle.

### MATERIALS NEEDED FOR THE COLORFUL MILK POLARITY EXPERIMENT:

![How to Make Colorful Milk Polarity Experiment - Materials Needed](/images/posts/How-to-Make-Colorful-Milk-Polarity-Experiment-Materials-Needed.jpg)
- Milk
- Plate
- Food colors
- Dishwashing soap
- Cotton swab

### INSTRUCTIONS ON DOING THE COLORFUL MILK POLARITY EXPERIMENT:

Watch the video at the beginning of the article for step by step instructions or continue reading.

1. Pour the milk into the plate (milk with more fat content is better).
2. Put few drops of food coloring in the middle (if the color is too thick, dilute it with few drops of water)
3. Soak the cotton swab into the dishwashing soap
4. Touch the colors with it and observe what happens!

### WHAT WILL YOU DEVELOP AND LEARN:

- Chemistry knowledge
- Concept of polarity
- What is soap and how does it work
- Mixing colors
- How to conduct an experiment
