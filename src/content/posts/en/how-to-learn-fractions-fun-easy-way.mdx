Let’s take a trip down memory lane. You are a third grader, sitting in your classroom. It’s a beautiful day outside, and all you would like to do is go play, but it’s math class so there will be no playing. Your teacher starts a lecture about [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)). He is writing numbers on the board, and you feel lost. She can tell you are not following and tries to explain it using more and more words, already a little annoyed. You feel like you will never be able to understand this and you don’t even see the point.

Don’t let your child feel that way! We don't need to teach fractions through boring lectures. A much better way is through visualization tools. And what better tool than LEGO bricks! Children love them and you probably have tons of them somewhere under the bed. Learning through play is the best kind of learning!

## What are Fractions in Mathematics?

A fraction is a number that tells us how many **parts of a whole** we have. We can recognize a fraction by the slash between the two numbers. For example, 3/6 is a fraction. In a fraction, we have a top number, the **numerator**, and a bottom number, the **denominator**. In our example, 3 would be the numerator and 6 would be the denominator.

We can try and explain a fraction using an example of pizza. If we picture a pizza, the bottom number tells us how many slices of pizza there is in total. The top number tells us how many slices we will take. So 3/6 tells us that the whole pizza contains 6 slices. We can take 3 of those 6 total slices. Now let’s eat those slices, all these explanations will make us all hungry.

### Proper and Improper Fractions

We can differentiate fractions in a few different ways. First, is on “**proper**” and “**improper**” fractions.

If the numerator is **less** than the denominator, then we talk about proper fractions. For example, 3/6 is a proper fraction. If the numerator is **greater** than the denominator, we talk about improper fractions. For example, 6/3 is an improper fraction.

Let’s get to our example with pizza. With proper fraction, we can take all slices from one pizza. So we can take 3 slices from pizza that has 6 slices. But with improper fractions, one pizza is not enough to take all slices. If we want to take 6 slices from the pizza that has only 3 slices, we can't do that. We need more than one pizza (2 pizzas with 3 slices in our example) to get all the slices.

### Like and Unlike Fractions

Second, we have **like** and **unlike** fractions.

Fractions that are the same, we call like fractions. What does “the same” mean? Let’s take for an example 3/6 and 4/8. If we take 3 slices from pizza that has 6 slices, there will stay half of the pizza (3/6=0.5). And if we take 4 slices of pizza that has 8 slices, there will also stay half of the pizza (4/8=0.5). So that means like fractions - when the result of the two fractions is the same. If we go and try to simplify like fractions, we will get the same number. And that is how we can tell like from unlike fractions.

Unlike fractions are those that don't give the same result. For example, 3/6 and 5/9 are unlike fractions because if we divide those two fractions, we won’t get the same result.

### Mixed Numbers

And lastly, we have **Mixed numbers** or also called **Mixed Fractions**. We get mixed numbers when we transform improper fraction into the proper fraction. With that transformation, we also get a whole number in front of the proper fraction. For example, 7/3 is an improper fraction. We can write it as 2 ⅓. Now we have a whole number and a proper fraction.

On our pizza example, we can’t take 7 slices from pizza that only has 3 slices right? So we need 3 slices from 3 slices pizza + 3 slices from 3 slices pizza + 1 slice from 3 slices pizza. And that equals 2 whole pizzas + one slice of pizza with three slices. Or 2 ⅓.

## Materials needed for fraction learning activity

- LEGO or any other cubes

## Instructions for activity

For a video guide on How to learn Fractions in a fun way, you can watch the video at the beginning of the article. Or continue reading for step by step guide.

### Adding fractions

![Lego bricks for easy learning of Adding](/images/posts/Lego-bricks-for-easy-learning-of-Adding.jpg)
Use lego bricks to learn how to add fractions.

Take one brick that will represent one whole (we chose one with a size of 8) and use it as a base. Pick any number of smaller bricks and see what part of the base they are. Combine them until you get to the length of the first one. You can do many different combinations (for example, combine 2 bricks of size 4: 4/8 + 4/ 8). Notice that 4/8 is the same as the half of the base brick. Try other combinations to express the same fractions!

### Subtracting fractions

![Easily Learn Subtracting with legos](/images/posts/Easily-Learn-Subtracting-with-legos.jpg)
We can also learn subtraction with legos.

Take one brick that will represent one whole and use it as a base. Take another, smaller brick and compare its size to the size of the base. See how much empty space we have and what brick you could put there. Notice the size of that brick. That is your answer!

### Multiplying fractions

![Learn Multiplying using lego bricks](/images/posts/Learn-Multiplying-using-lego-bricks.jpg)
And easy and fun multiplying with legos.

This is like adding, but now we will group our fractions. Take one brick that will represent one whole (we chose one with a size of 6) and use it as a base. Pick any number of smaller bricks and see what part of the base they are. Combine them until you get to the length of the first one. See how many different groups you need. You can do many different combinations (for example, combine 2 bricks of size 3:  2\*3/6).

## What will you learn and develop?
