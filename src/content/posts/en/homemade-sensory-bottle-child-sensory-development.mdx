### WHAT IS SENSORIMOTOR DEVELOPMENT:

**Sensorimotor development** is a process of **cognitive** and **motor** development through our reactions to the external **stimuli** using our **senses** and **perception**.

It means that humans, like all living beings, will react to the things that are happening around us and through that we will learn.

We use our senses: (1) **Sight**, (2) **Smell**, (3) **Hearing**, (4) **Taste** and (5) **Touch** to receive information from our surroundings and we react to that based on our innate **instincts** and past **learning experience.**

Sensorimotor development is crucial in infant development, from **age** **of 0** to **24 months** of age because that is the development stage when children rely the most on basic senses to learn. Of course, sensorimotor development happens whole life, but it is most important in those early ages because then is the time when those important **neural connections** in our brain are being created.

We won’t go into more details here, but we got you covered: You can read all about [Sensorimotor development and activities for Children](https://www.stemlittleexplorers.com/en/sensorimotor-activities-children/) that you can make and use at your home.

In this article, we will cover one activity that you can use for sensorimotor development - **Sensory Bottle.**

### TIPS ON USING SENSORY BOTTLE:

There are tons of ways you can make the Sensory bottle. All you need is a… well… Bottle! Everything else is mostly left to your imagination and creativity.

Making sensory bottle can also be an excellent activity for **older children** who can use the process of creating it for learning about different substances, chemical and physical properties of materials in use.

For **toddlers**, the sensory bottle can be used for sensorimotor stimulation and emotional regulation. Since toddlers are capable of manipulating objects on their own, they are capable manipulating the bottle with their own hands. So you can use bottles with different shapes and textures to engage your child in full spectrum of sensorimotor stimulation and development.

As for **infants**, they probably won’t be able to physically manipulate sensory bottle but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be using it. On the contrary, the sensory bottle is one of best toys for infants. Since they mostly rely on audio and visual stimuli from their surroundings, the sensory bottle is a great learning tool. You can shake the bottle, squeeze it, rotate it and see how your child will be interested in the effects. A Sensory bottle is a great tool that helps you provide right stimuli for your infant brain development.
