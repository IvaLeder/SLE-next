### What is Intelligence?

What is intelligence actually? There are many definitions but let’s use the simple one: “**Intelligence is** the ability to successfully overcome new situations and challenges”.
Or my favorite, “Intelligence is the thing that intelligence tests measure”. This last definition shows that this term is still the in focus of many debates and there is no one way to define intelligence.

But what everyone agrees on is that the Intelligence is a **potential** for solving problems and challenges. But that potential is nothing without tendering it and improving it through hard work and developing your skills further.
That’s the reason why it’s important to recognize that potential in your child. To nourish it and to support your child in developing it further.

### Difference between Intelligence and “Gift” or Gifted child:

When we talk about Intelligence, we mostly think about general ability - as a potential to be good in everything. In psychology, that is called **G factor** or **General factor of intelligence**. It’s the idea that the intelligent person will be good in every challenge you throw at him. This is still mostly used meaning in the everyday talk about intelligence.

But the truth is, that G factor is actuall[![18 signs of a gifted child - S factor of intelligence](/images/posts/18-signs-of-a-gifted-child-S-factor-of-intelligence-300x298.jpg "18 signs of a gifted child - S factor of intelligence")](https://www.stemlittleexplorers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/18-signs-of-a-gifted-child-S-factor-of-intelligence.jpg)y a collection of different **S factors** or **Specific factors** of Intelligence. In other words, we can say that S factor is what we call **gift.** When we call someone **gifted**, we say that he has a high Intelligence in that field.  
Some theories recognize more than 100 S factors, but to name a few, it can be all from **cognitive processing** and **memory** to **dancing**, **playing an instrument** or **athletic gifts**.

#### **18) Mental disabilities and giftedness are not mutually exclusive**

If your child has an condition like autism or ADHD it doesn’t mean that it is not gifted!

You may have heard about term **savant syndrome** which means that someone with a mental disability can be highly gifted in a particular field.

It is just a potential. Without hard work, and stimulating environment, that potential will fade. So don’t let it go to the waste and encourage a child in the field it is good at.
